-------------------

 o what is maximum current we want to detect? 20A, shunt resistor 1w dissipation @20A (800W) load
 o temperature overload enable something (low-side mosfet)
 o freewheel ADC in seperate uC, moving reading to main uC via serial

Old plan
--------

 o test voltage sense with resistor - required voltage gain and stability is achieved
 o test voltage sensw with oscillator source 0 - 1Vpp

Current plan
------------
 o STM32F207 microcontroller running @72MHz
 o 0-20A current sensing with ACS712ELCTR 20A. how to get 3.3V range (newest is ACS722LLCTR-20AU-T)
 o MicroSD card
 o pedal sensing to interrupt pin (ground + sense), high impedance  \
 o gas position sensing (ground + gas), high impedance               => common ground input, with three inputs
 o current speed input from hall sensor (ground + hall)             /
 o beeper for battery error
 o button for battery error acknowledgment
 o 44V - 20V battery voltage sensor range
 o ADC stability
	o use precision voltage reference. How to get stable 5V reference?
	o filter the input with multiple caps

 o Connectors for each battery cell voltage
 o BMS ideas can be taken from https://github.com/rickygu/openBMS
